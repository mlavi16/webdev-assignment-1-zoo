                    Any of about a dozen tropical reptile species (family Crocodilidae) found in Asia, the Australian
                    region, Africa, Madagascar, and the Americas. Crocodiles are long-snouted, lizardlike carnivores.
                    Crocodiles swim and feed in the water, floating at the surface to wait for
                    prey, but bask in the sun and breed on land. They are reputed to be livelier than alligators and
                    more likely to attack humans. They have a narrower snout than alligators and a tooth on each side of
                    the jaw that is visible when the jaw is closed.

                    Crocodiles are mostly nocturnal animals. They are predators and spend most of their time in the
                    water; although they are also known to make journeys of several kilometres over land. In the first
                    weeks of life, crocodiles eat insects, crustaceans, snails, small fishes, frogs, and tadpoles. Older
                    crocodiles mainly eat fish and are more apt to prey upon waterfowl and on mammals. Crocodiles capture
                    water animals in their jaws with a sideways movement of the muzzle. They have sensitive pressure
                    receptors located in pits in the scales around the mouth that detect motion; these structures assist
                    in the capture of prey in dark or murky water. To catch land animals, a crocodile floats passively
                    or remains motionless at the edge of the water where prey habitually drink. With a sudden lunge, it
                    seizes an unsuspecting animal and drowns it. If the prey is large, a crocodile may grip portions of
                    the victim in its jaws and rotate rapidly in the water to tear the prey apart.
