                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Pygmy elephants usually grow between 2.5 meters to 3 meters. Males are usually a bit larger than
                    females. Pygmy elephants are chubby elephants with large ears and a long tail that drags behind them
                    when they walk. The males also have straight tusks. Females rarely have tusks but if they do, they
                    are only visible when they open their mouth. Pygmy elephants weigh between 6,500lbs - 11,000lbs
                    (3,000kg - 5,000kg). Pygmy elephants live about 55 to 70 years in the wild and over 80 years in
                    captivity. Their skin is leathery and their skin color is a mix in between dark grey and brown. They
                    are called pygmy elephants because of their size and the fact that they are less aggressive than
                    other Asian elephants.

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    Pygmy elephants' diet in the wild is palms, grasses, and wild bananas. A single adult can eat up to
                    150 kg of vegetation. These elephants also love durian (type of spiny tropical fruit), they will
                    take the entire fruit (with the spikes), roll it in the mud and swallow it whole. In zoo's, the
                    workers try to give the elephants similar to what they would get in the wild but they make sure it's
                    balanced nutrition. They also give the elephants salt licks which have the minerals the elephants
                    need. In the wild, they would get the minerals from clear rich soils. Pygmy elephants also need to
                    drink water at least once a day. They only travel near water sources and they are very good
                    swimmers.
