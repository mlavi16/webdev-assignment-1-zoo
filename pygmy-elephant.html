                Pygmy elephants usually grow between 2.5 meters to 3 meters. Males are usually a bit larger than
                females. Pygmy elephants are chubby elephants with large ears and a long tail that drags behind them
                when they walk. The males also have straight tusks. Females rarely have tusks but if they do, they
                are only visible when they open their mouth. Pygmy elephants weigh between 6,500lbs - 11,000lbs
                (3,000kg - 5,000kg). Pygmy elephants live about 55 to 70 years in the wild and over 80 years in
                captivity. Their skin is leathery and their skin color is a mix in between dark grey and brown. They
                are called pygmy elephants because of their size and the fact that they are less aggressive than
                other Asian elephants.
