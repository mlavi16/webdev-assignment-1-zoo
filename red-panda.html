                <p class="informational-text">
                    Red pandas live in high-altitude, temperate forests with bamboo understories in the Himalayas and
                    other high mountains. They range from northern Myanmar (Burma) to the west Sichuan and Yunnan
                    Provinces of China. They are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees.

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p class="informational-text">
                    Bamboo constitutes about 95% of the red panda's diet. Unlike giant pandas that feed on nearly every
                    above-ground portion of bamboo (including the culm, or woody stem), red pandas feed selectively on
                    the most nutritious leaf tips and, when available, tender shoots. Like giant pandas, red pandas
                    grasp plant stems using their forepaws and shear selected leaves off with their mouths. Because red
                    pandas are obligate bamboo eaters, they are on a tight energy budget for much of the year. They may
                    also forage for roots, succulent grasses, fruits, insects and grubs, and are known to occasionally
                    kill and eat birds and small mammals.

                <h3>Social Habits</h3>
                <p class="informational-text">
                    Red pandas are solitary except during the breeding season. In human care, most breeding pairs live
                    together year-round. In the wild, the home range of one animal is about 1 square mile.
                    <br>
                    Red pandas are generally quiet, but subtle vocalizations—such as squeals, twitters and
                    huff-quacks—can be heard at close proximity. They may also hiss or grunt, and young cubs use a
                    whistle, or high-pitched bleat, to signal distress.

                <h3>Sleep Habits</h3>
                <p class="informational-text">
                    In human care, red pandas can be active at any time of day but are primarily crepuscular, or most
                    active at dawn and dusk. On average, they spend about 45 percent of the day awake and tend to be
                    more active in cooler weather, especially during the winter mating season.
                    In significantly cold temperatures, red pandas can become dormant, lowering their metabolic rate and
                    raising it every few hours as they wake up to look for food.

                    <span class="text-danger">Endangered</span>
                </h3>
                <p class="informational-text">
                    The red panda is considered an endangered species, with less than 10,000 individuals left in the
                    wild and captivity. The loss of nesting trees and bamboo is causing a decline in red panda
                    populations across much of their range because their forest home is being cleared. Additionally, red
                    pandas are often killed when they get caught in traps meant for other animals such as wild pigs and
                    deer. They are also poached for their distinctive pelts, and red panda fur caps or hats have been
                    found for sale.
